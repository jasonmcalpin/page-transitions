page-transitions
================

a script that transitions the page when entering and leaving. 

Just attach it as the first script to run. will automatically hide then show every page. 


CHANGE NOTES
ver 0.5.5 archived version. modernized code in case I want to use it. IE detection removed. 

Ver 0.5.4 alpha version. Bug fix. Exception looks for # anywhere in url.

Ver 0.5.3 alpha version. Added exceptions for links that don't leave page.

Ver 0.1.0 alpha version. basic fade in on page load and fade out on button click.


TO DO
Optimize it to start first. 
Smooth animation
Differentiate between 'A' tags with links and those that don't (don't want it hiding page when using a slide show for instance. )
Keep it under 5k so it loads FAST
